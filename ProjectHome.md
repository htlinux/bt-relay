This is a simple board that features a 5V/10A relay, a PIC microcontroller and a bluetooth module for serial communication.

The microcontroller is programmed (using MPLAB 8 & XC8 compiler from Microchip) with a simple serial protocol to control the relay, get its status, turn it on/off after X quantity of seconds, etc.

Also, a simple demo Android application has been implemented to control some of the features of the bluetooth controlled relay board.

This is a very simple project for anyone trying to control appliances wirelessly/remotely.

The bluetooth module can be easily changed to any other serial module, like USB/Serial module, Zigbee module, etc.

The board schematics and the PCB design is also available in the sources repository.
